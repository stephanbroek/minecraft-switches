Switches
======

This is a quick minecraft mod project to add a 2 pressure plate like blocks which detect items/mobs
above the block rather than in the block. The main reason it was made is to work with the AE2 crystal
growth accellerators. Allowing you to turn them on only when items are in the water.

Current build 

Known bugs
-------

* Mobs fall into the block
* blocks currently share a state so they won't turn off until ALL would turn off.
